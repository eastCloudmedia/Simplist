##Simplist
###Simplist is a mini framework based on PHP language for small projects.
We strongly suggest our framework for personal blogs, news agencies & human resource management.




Just like any other PHP framework we started this project based on MVC architecture with the featured services like `$Add->Loader` , `gVerb` | `pVerb` , SharedLayouts, Middlewares & pre-defined security.
Everything in simplist is as simple as installing it on your server!
